# NOTE 

* THE API WILL SOMETIMES SHOW NO DATA, better to visit and check data (only first time of app launching)
* THE APP IS NOT COMPLETELY REAL TIME, but some parts are real time.
* ONLY, one product showed as example of 3D model, you can add more.
* PAYMENT, payment integration is stripe (on test mode)
* APP MAY CONTAIN MISSING FUNCTIONALITY, you can add , pull and push it back
